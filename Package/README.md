# Aureus
---------------------

Aureus is a privacy, accessibility, and safety-focused design system built in Flutter for non-profit software development. 

Developed for internal use at Astra Labs, Aureus is designed to quickly build quality software that serves vulnerable communities.

In our years of developing at Astra, we've run into crucial problems designing for specifically at-risk populations. 

When you're working in tough / crisis situations, a lot of industry design patterns do not truly take into account the fragility and level of caution required. 

Our goal is to help build some insight into how our resources work, and to hopefully be a good example of scalable, high-impact, and ethical software that truly allows us to focus on our goal of making help a tap away for everyone. 

---------------------

Aureus is different from other design systems by: 
* Focusing solely on building a design system specifically meant for use with vulnerable populations. 
* Prioritizing user safety and trust above everything else.
* Building around accessibility, and not tacking it on after.
* Removing all dark patterns and other design tactics that can be used unethically.
* Pre-creating elements for use in time sensitive, emergency situations.

---------------------

It contains 
* 100+ out of the box components, elements, and templated views that automatically adjust to light / dark mode, and desktop / tablet / mobile usage to make it deployable across all platforms and modes. 
* pre-integrated safety functionality, permissions & data handling, and accessibility support that will hopefully meet Level AA compliance with WCAG 2.1. 
* implementation guides & documentation for easy understanding.
