## Structure
Items in Aureus's codebase are broken up into three parts: 

* Core: All global variables & functionality that’s used in development.

-   Foundation.dart: Where the majority of global variables are. This is where colors, text styles, backings, and more reside.
-   Safety.dart: Where all safety related functionality lives.
-   Accessibility.dart: Where accessibility / contrast functionality lives. 
    
* Objects: Objects you pass to widgets that display information. Not all widgets will have accompanying objects, but more complex ones will. 
* Widgets: UI Components that display information & complete functionality.

Items in Aureus’ codebase are to be categorized the same as in the Figma file. If any documentation conflicts, the Figma file is the source of truth.
