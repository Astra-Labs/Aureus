# Exchange of Trust 
#### Last Updated: 12/7/2021
--------------------

Our work at Astra Labs is inheritently emotional. We want to create a place where the emotions that come up for our users are welcomed, given space, and handled with care.  
  
Overall, we do that through service and trust. There is an inherent hand off of trust in day to day life. Think of all of the people you rely on to not drive on the wrong side of the road. The buildings you enter into trusting they’ll hold. Every day, every action with others, is an exchange of trust. We need to make that exchange as comfortable as possible so people know that they’re in good hands.  
  
We’re trying to get our users home safely. We just need to build designs that allow them to trust us to be able to do that.  
  
We have to earn the user’s trust, we are not entitled to it. A portion of this trust starts with design: removing dark patterns, foregoing dopamine traps, and building for what’s best for the user, not what’s best for us.

With sensitive issues, it's imperative that the exchange of trust is as easy, comfortable, and as straight-forward as possible. When designing Aureus, our main prority was to build a system for designing and developing software that enabled people to trust us, and enabled us to earn that trust, so that we can achieve our mission of building resources where help is only a tap away. 

--------------------

## Building trustable designs.
The basics of building a trustable design can be broken into 

### 1. Comfortable
Intitutive, and easily navigatable designs that you don’t need a user manual to figure out. Based off of best practices from other established designs in the field.

### 2. Clean
Minimalist, unclutted, and cut-straight to the point. No bullshit. Just the help they need, and none of the frills they don’t

### 3. Clear
Understandable, and easily intrepreted copy. No room for misinterpretation or confusion.

### 4. Consistent
The same experience across all of our products, designs, apps, and more. All designs under the UDS need to reflect changes in unison

## Defining our resources. 
To define what makes something an 'Astra Labs' resource, we developed the following resource QA for Aureus, and all of our other resources. 

#### 1. Resilience
[ ] Built-in obsolescence to give users tools to develop resilience / leave a situation so that they don’t have to use us anymore.

[ ] Ability to see progress / change over time, so that they have measures of when they are finished / don’t need us.

[ ] Functionality that allows user to control the level of support they get.

#### 2. Usability
[ ] Core functionality is incredibly full featured and could be a stand alone piece of software for each different function.
[ ] Different pieces of core functionality help the user over different time frames / phases of an issue (immediate needs vs. long term needs). At every stage of what someone is going through, there’s a functionality that covers it.

#### 3. Trust
**Functionality**
[ ] Having a safety plan for users that gives them control of the functionality
[ ] Give users the ability to preview the tools before they give us any data, and to see them in “demo“ in onboarding
[ ] There’s explicit data opt-ins that user must complete
[ ] Content / copy that specifically works to center the user, and their experiences.
[ ] Explicitly coded empathy in harder situations, affirmations & validation in more emotionally vulnerable situations

**Communication**
[ ] Consistency from tools
[ ] Clear and concise language so that the user understands the tool clearly
[ ] Accessible descriptions that someone from any background can understand
[ ] Clear and explicit data opt-in - never hide stuff from the user. If they want it, they should be able to find it.
[ ] Error messages are clear, and provide actionable reasons / steps to take for them to fix it.

#### 4. Safety
[ ] Functionality is consistent across ALL platforms. It all looks the same, and rolls out at the same time.

[ ] Designs are current and updated to look like they came from this century.

[ ] Functionality / items that don’t work are not just greyed out. They are fully removed. Only things that are fully functional are in the resource, and they are removed when not fully functional.

[ ] Ease of use is priority #1. You never feel safe or calm trying to figure out a confusing interface. We provide options for the user that are pre-filled in, and make the calls to action clear and few.

[ ] Priority for sensitive objects is clear, and the most accessible.

[ ] Fewer options when it makes the functionality clearer / easier to use. (e.g: 5 / 10 minute increments as opposed to 1 minute increments)

#### 5. Nature
[ ] All items look like an extension of nature, and not specifically like a piece of software that means to grab your attention. It should feel like someone transposed UI elements over the sky.

[ ] Haze / gradients that look like they are from a dream / nature / the sky.

[ ] Each resource has a theme that pulls from nature (landscape / biome / animal / phoneme) that it uses in the logo, icons, and other design elements.
