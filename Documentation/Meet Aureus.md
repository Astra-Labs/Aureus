# Meet Aureus 
#### Last Updated: 12/7/2021

Aureus (pronouced Ore-riss) is Astra Labs' Universal Design System (or UDS for short). The design system is broken into a couple of different parts: 

## Contents
* Where everything is located and indexed for you to find easily. 

## Introduction
* An thorough explanation of what Aureus is, how we designed it, and what using it looks like. 

## Core
* Covers the introduction to the 'central' parts of Aureus: our accessibility, safety plan, and foundational variables. 

## Elements
* Singular 'base' widgets that can be stacked with other widgets to stand alone or create components.

## Components
* Nested elements / widgets that are basically actionable parts of the UI. Components DO have an action they are linked to.
* EXAMPLE: A grid collection of items.

## Views
* Views are templates that we re-use a lot through our resources. 
* EXAMPLE: Data opt-in page.

## Functionality
* Aureus has a Safety Plan functionality, which privately handles user safety settings and gives you a place to program alternate methods of doing something when one of those safety settings is violated.
