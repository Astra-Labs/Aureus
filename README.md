### Meet Aureus, 
a privacy, accessibility, and safety-focused design system built in Flutter for non-profit software development. 

---------------------

### For our future, today. 
* Developed specifically for low-resource non-profits and beginning developers, we want to make Aureus as easy as possible so you can build your own software, and your own movements. 

### Reach everyone, everywhere. 
* Utilizing the power and scale of Flutter, which allows for Aureus applications to be used on web, mobile, tablets, desktop, and more. For non-profits with limited budgets, this allows the most amount of reach for the least amount of development costs. 
* Given the massive cross-platform capability of Flutter, this means almost anyone with a device on the internet can use a Flutter application. 

### Reach everyone, everywhere. 
* Working to be incredibly human-readable and beginner friendly for new developers. We want people who have never programmed before to be able to find resources, and ultimately develop with Aureus. 
* We aim to not only build strong documentation, but a strong directory to direct people on where to go when first learning how to code.
* Astra has also taken the initiative to develop a resource library on our website, where we explain more about product, software, and strategy development for user safety critical applications. [You can submit a proposal to write for our resource library here.]() 

### Design for safety, not for subscriptions.
* Prioritizing user safety and trust above everything else. Not only pre-creating elements for use in emergency situations, but allowing developers to build custom safety plans for their users to opt-in to during onboarding. 
* We also designed views specifically with building trust in mind. For example, the onboarding landing page allows the user to explore the app and what it offers before moving into the onboarding flow - giving users the opportunity to explore without pressure.

### Accessibility as a promise, not an afterthought. 
* Building around accessibility, and not tacking it on after. Every custom Aureus component has the proper semantics labeling and focus nodes for use with assistive technology. 
* Aureus directly links into accessibility settings, and turns off animations, auto-scales text, provides high contrast, and more. 
* We also have semantics wrappers that can easily be used to extend accessibility to custom components built outside of the library, making accessibility easier to adopt. 

---------------------

It contains 
* 100+ out of the box components, elements, and templated views that automatically adjust to light / dark mode, and desktop / tablet / mobile usage to make it deployable across all platforms and modes. 
* pre-integrated safety functionality, permissions & data handling, and accessibility support that will hopefully meet Level AA compliance with WCAG 2.1. 
* implementation guides & documentation for easy understanding.
