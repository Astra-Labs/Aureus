# Aureus
This is Aureus - Astra Labs' Design System fully written in Dart / Flutter, designed in Figma, and documented for you.

#### About Aureus. 
In our years of developing at Astra, we've run into crucial problems designing for specifically at-risk populations. When you're working in tough / crisis situations, a lot of industry design patterns don't cut it. As we transition all of our codebases to Flutter, we've decided to build (and open source) our UDS into Aureus. 

It contains 
*out of the box UI components that automatically adjust to light / dark mode. 
*safety, data handling, and accessibility functionality. 
* implementation guides & other documentation to help you learn how to build apps for the first time. 

Aureus is different from other design systems by: 
* Prioritizing user safety and trust above everything else.
* Building around accessibility, and not tacking it on after.
* Removing all dark patterns and other design tactics that can be used unethically.
* Pre-creating elements for use in time sensitive, emergency situations.
* Comprehensive documentation about implementation of accessibility / ethics.

Basically, if you're looking for an ethical design system while you build a tech-for-good product: Aureus is your friend. Building ethical tech is hard. Aureus is a culmination of those learnings from our years, and sharing them with you so that you have a starting point for what ethical tech looks like.
