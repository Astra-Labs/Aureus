Meet Aureus, a privacy, accessibility, and safety-focused design system built in Flutter for non-profit software development. 

Originally developed for internal use at Astra Labs, Aureus is designed to quickly build quality software that serves vulnerable communities. In our years of developing at Astra, we've run into crucial problems designing for specifically at-risk populations.

When you're working in tough / crisis situations, a lot of industry design patterns do not truly take into account the fragility and level of caution required. Our goal is to help build some insight into how our resources work, and to hopefully be a good example of scalable, high-impact, and ethical software.

---------------------

### For our future, today. 
* Developed specifically for resource constrained non-profits and beginner developers, we made building an app with Aureus as easy as possible so you can build your own software, and your own movements.

### Reach everyone, everywhere. 
* Utilizing the scale of Flutter allows for Aureus Resources to be used on web, mobile, tablets, desktop, and more. For those with limited budgets, this allows the most amount of reach for the least amount of development costs.
* The massive cross-platform capability of Flutter means almost anyone with a device on the internet can use a Flutter application.

### Built for beginners. 
* Aureus is incredibly human-readable, and beginner friendly for new developers.
* We aim to not only build strong documentation, but a strong directory to direct people on where to go when first learning how to code.
* Astra has also taken the initiative to develop a resource library on our website, where we explain more about product, software, and strategy development for user safety critical applications. 

### Design for safety, not for subscriptions.
* Aureus prioritizes user safety and trust above everything else. It not only pre-creates elements for use in emergency situations, but allows developers to build custom safety plans for their users to opt-in to during onboarding. These safety features are automatically handled within the templates, leaving you to focus on feature development and community engagement. 

### Accessibility as a promise, not an afterthought. 
* Aureus is built around accessibility, not tacking it on after. Every custom Aureus component has the proper semantics labeling and focus nodes for use with assistive technology.
* Aureus directly links into the userâ€™s accessibility settings, and automatically turns off animations, auto-scales text, provides high contrast, and more.
* We also have semantic wrappers that can easily be used to extend accessibility to custom components built outside of the library, making accessibility easier to adopt.

---------------------

It contains 
* 100+ out of the box components, elements, and templated views that automatically adjust to light / dark mode, and desktop / tablet / mobile usage to make it deployable across all platforms and modes. 
* pre-integrated safety functionality, permissions & data handling, and accessibility support that will hopefully meet Level AA compliance with WCAG 2.1. 
* implementation guides & documentation for easy understanding.
